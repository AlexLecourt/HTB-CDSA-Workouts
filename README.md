<h1>HTB-CDSA Hands-On !</h1>


<h2>Hack the Box - Certified Defensive Security Analyst üõ°Ô∏è</h2>
The Certified Defensive Security Analyst (CDSA) journey with Hack the Box has been one of the most intellectually challenging experiences of my life. Starting with no prior knowledge in IT and without anyone to guide me, I embarked on this path determined to succeed.

Over the course of 7 months, I navigated countless obstacles, including not knowing how to connect to the labs or virtual machines at the beginning of my journey. Every chapter felt like a battle, an exhilarating mix of excitement and apprehension as I tackled each new challenge head-on.

This repository was created for two main reasons:

    To showcase my hard work and progress.
    To ensure I never forget this incredible journey.

I'm truly proud of what I‚Äôve achieved, the knowledge I‚Äôve gained, and the persistence I showed throughout. This accomplishment is proof that determination and resilience can overcome even the steepest learning curves.
