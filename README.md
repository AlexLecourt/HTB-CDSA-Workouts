# 🎯 HTB-CDSA Hands-On!  

## Hack the Box - Certified Defensive Security Analyst 🛡️  

The **Certified Defensive Security Analyst (CDSA)** journey with Hack the Box has been one of the most intellectually challenging experiences of my life. Starting with no prior knowledge in IT and without anyone to guide me, I embarked on this path determined to succeed.  

Over the course of **7 months**, I navigated countless obstacles, including not knowing how to connect to the labs or virtual machines at the beginning of my journey. Every chapter felt like a battle—an exhilarating mix of excitement and apprehension as I tackled each new challenge head-on.  

This repository was created for two main reasons:  
1. To **showcase my hard work and progress.**  
2. To **ensure I never forget this incredible journey.**  

I'm truly proud of what I’ve achieved, the knowledge I’ve gained, and the persistence I showed throughout. This accomplishment is proof that determination and resilience can overcome even the steepest learning curves.
